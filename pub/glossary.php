We realize that many of the terms used in the tool are difficult to understand
and many have a particular legal meaning. We've tried to explain some of the
more complex or legalistic terms below in as human-readable language as we can.
Of course, none of our explanations are a substitute for the real legal
definition of a term - they are just guides designed to assist you to better
understand and use the tool.
</div>
</div>

<div id="agreement">
<h3><a href="#agreement">Agreement or transfer</a></h3>
<p>
When used in this tool, this term means any agreement under which the author or
artist of a copyrighted work grants another person some or all of the copyright
rights in relation to that work. An agreement can refer just to one particular
use of a copyrighted work such a license of the right to publish the work; or
it can refer to the entire copyright, for example, an assignment of copyright
ownership.  The kinds of agreements or transfers that can be terminated
include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  A transfer of ownership of copyright of either the whole copyright or of
  specific rights in copyright.  This is often referred to as an "assignment;"
  </li><li>
  An exclusive license of one, more or all of the copyright rights, for
  example, an exclusive license to publish and distribute a sound recording;
  </li><li>
  A non-exclusive license of one, more or all of the copyright rights, for
  example a non-exclusive license to play a song on the radio;
  </li><li>
  A mortgage or other security on copyright;
  </li><li>
  And, in the words of the U.S. Copyright Act, "any other conveyance,
  alienation, or hypothecation of a copyright or of any of the exclusive rights
  comprised in copyright."
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
All of these agreements - with the exception of non-exclusive licenses - must
be in writing, so if you have a copy of an agreement, you should be able to
identify what type of transfer it is by reviewing the agreement.  To learn more
about where to find out details about the type of agreement, check out our
<a href="../documents.php">List of Useful Documents</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="author">
<h3><a name="#author">Authors and artists</a></h3>
<p>
When used in this tool, this term means the original creator of a work
protected by copyright - the person who commits pen to paper, snaps the
picture, draws the cartoon, or hits "save" on the computer. When used in this
tool, this term does not mean an employer, nor does it refer to the person or
company that commissions work. For employment-created works or commissioned
works, see the definition of a
<a class="glossarylink" href="#work_for_hire">"work for hire."</a>
</p>
</div>

<div id="authors_family">
<h3><a name="#authors_family">Author's immediate family and representatives</a></h3>
<p>
When used in the tool, this term refers to different categories of people.
These categories become relevant, in the case of pre-1978 agreements or
transfers, if one of these people signed the agreement or transfer that you are
seeking to terminate, or if the author or artist is no longer living, to
determine who may exercise the right to terminate an agreement or transfer.
</p><p>
For pre-1978 agreements, when identifying whether an agreement or transfer
(signed by someone other than the author or artist) can be terminated, the term
refers to the author or artist's
<a class="glossarylink" href="#widow">widow(er)</a>,
<a class="glossarylink" href="#children">children</a>,
<a class="glossarylink" href="#executors">executors</a> or
<a class="glossarylink" href="#next_of_kin">next of kin</a>.
</p><p>
When identifying who else (other than the deceased author or artist) may
terminate an agreement or transfer that was signed by the author or artist, the
term refers to the author or artist's
<a class="glossarylink" href="#widow">widow(er)</a>,
<a class="glossarylink" href="#children">children</a> or
<a class="glossarylink" href="#grandchildren">grandchildren</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="children">
<h3><a name="#children">Children</a></h3>
<p>
Since 1978, US copyright law defines the term "children" to include a person's
immediate offspring, whether legitimate or not, and any children legally
adopted.
</p><p>
Prior to January 1, 1978 the definition may vary because it depended on
applicable state law. When completing the tool, if the agreement is dated
before January 1, 1978, it's probably best to treat the term "children" as
broadly as possible so that you can see if a termination right otherwise exists
and then, if it does, you can raise this issue with the attorney who assists
you with progressing your termination claim.
</p>
</div>

<div id="compilation">
<h3><a name="#compilation">Compilation</a></h3>
<p>
This term means a collection of materials or data that is co-ordinated,
selected or arranged in such a way as to create a new copyrighted work in the 
collection. The specific examples given in the US Copyright Act include catalogs 
directories and software programs; but the term extends beyond just written 
works to include all types of compilations of
<a class="glossarylink" href="#type_of_work">copyrighted works</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="collective_work">
<h3><a name="#collective_work">Collective work</a></h3>
<p>
This term means a combination of works, which are each themselves independent
and separate works protected by copyright. The specific examples given in the
US Copyright Act include a magazine, an anthology or an encyclopedia but the
term extends beyond just written works to include all types of compilations of 
copyrighted works.
</p>
</div>

<div id="copyright_law">
<h3><a name="#copyright_law">Copyright Law</a></h3>
<p>
This is a law that grants protection to certain categories of creative,
expressive works. Generally, works that are protected by copyright are: written
works such as books, scripts, websites, lesson plans, and any other forms of
writings; visual works such as photographs; audiovisual works such as films,
videos and video games; music such as musical compositions and sound
recordings; artistic works such as artworks, paintings, sculptures and
architectural works.
</p><p>
As a general rule, copyright law does not protect ideas, factual information or
other things that are not protected by copyright. The US Copyright Office
provides more information about the scope of copyright law
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#wnp">here</a>.
</p><p>
The protection that the law gives to copyrighted works is in the form of
exclusive rights. These exclusive rights give the owner of copyright in a work
the ability to control who may exercise those rights and engage in certain
activities with their work. Under US copyright law, these activities include
copying, distributing, performing to the public, adapting, displaying in public
or transmitting the work online.
</p>
</div>

<div id="registration_number">
<h3><a name="#registration_number">Copyright registration number</a></h3>
<p>
This is the number that is given by the US Copyright Office on the certificate
of registration; the certificate of registration confirms that a copyright work
has been registered with the US Copyright Office.  See the
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#cr">US Copyright Office's website</a>
for more information about registration.
</p>
</div>

<div id="creation_date">
<h3><a name="#creation_date">Creation (of the Work)</a></h3>
<p>
A work that is protected by copyright law is "created" when it is first
recorded, stored or fixed in a material form from which it can be again
reproduced, perceived or communicated. This means, for example, that a
copyright protected work is created when you put pen to paper, hit save on your
computer or record on your video camera.
</p>
</div>

<div id="agent">
<h3><a name="#agent">Duly authorized agent</a></h3>
<p>
This term refers to anyone who has authority to act for the owner of a
termination interest.  The term is not defined in the US Copyright Act but it
would seem that a person can be a "duly authorized agent" for someone else for
termination purposes either by express appointment or by operation of law.
</p><p>
In the case of an express appointment, this would mean that the person entitled
to terminate an agreement under the termination of transfer provisions took
steps to authorize someone else to act for them in relation to their
termination interest.  It is not required that the authority be in writing but
it can be prudent so that it is clear what the precise parameters of the
authority are and so that it is easy to prove, if challenged.
</p><p>
In the case of a person becoming a duly authorized agent by operation of law,
the US Congress made clear the term "duly authorized agent'" is also intended
to cover a legally appointed guardian for a children below the legal age or
anyone appointed to represent the interests a person incompetent to sign
because of age or mental disability.
</p>
</div>

<div id="scope_of_employment">
<h3><a name="#scope_of_employment">Employment, work created within the scope of</a></h3>
<p>
There is no clear rule as to when a work is created within the scope of a
person's employment and when it is not.
</p><p>
Prior to 1978, typically a court would consider that the employer was the
author and first owner of copyright in all works that were created by an
employee during the regular course of business.  In addition, a person or
company that hired someone else to create a work would be the first owner of
copyright if they had the right or ability to supervise the creation of that
work.
</p><p>
From 1978 onwards, a court will consider a range of factors to determine
whether a work was created within the scope of employment including: the
ability of the hiring party to control the manner and means of creation of
works; the skill required; the provision of employee benefits; the tax
treatment of the hired party; and whether the hiring party has the right to
assign additional projects to the hired party. If the hiring party has a large
degree of control of the tasks performed and can assign additional projects on
an ongoing basis and the hired party receives employee benefits and being taxed
as an employee, then it is more likely that a work is created within the scope
of employment. Other factors may include who provides the tools and equipment
(the hiring or hired party), the location of the work, the duration of the
relationship between the parties, whether the hiring party hires and pays
assistants and whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring
party.
</p><p>
As you can see, both tests are highly-circumstance specific.  When using the
tool, you can assume that the work was not created within circumstances of
employment (works created in circumstances of employment qualify as
<a class="glossarylink" href="#work_for_hire">"works for hire"</a> are not
eligible for termination, see
<a href="faq.php#What_kinds_of_agreements_cannot_be_terminated.3F">What kinds of
agreements cannot be terminated?</a> for more details) and continue to use the
tool to see if a termination right otherwise arises and then, if it does, you
can raise this issue with the attorney who assist you in progressing your
termination claim.  Alternately, if you are unsure as to whether the work in
question was created within the circumstances of employment, you may want to
get some legal advice on this issue before proceeding with the tool.
</p>
</div>

<div id="executors">
<h3><a name="#executors">Executors</a></h3>
<p>
When used in the context of pre-1978 agreements and transfers that are signed
by someone other than the author, this term refers to executors only.  An
executor is a person who is designated in the author or artist's will to act on
the author or artist's wishes as set out in their will.
</p><p>
When used in the context of an agreement or transfer of any date (pre- or
post-1978) where the author or artist dies after October 27, 1998 with no
surviving immediate family, this term refers to "executors, administrators,
personal representatives, or trustees."  Prior to October 27, 1998 (when the US
Sony Bono Copyright Term Extension Act 1998 (CTEA) passed), if the author or
artist died prior to being able to exercise their termination of transfer right
and there was no surviving spouse, children or grandchildren, the termination
right would lapse.  With the passage of the CTEA, instead of lapsing the right
could be exercised by either "the author's executor, administrator, personal
representative, or trustee."  The term executor, again, is a person who is
designated in the author or artist's will to act on the author or artist's
wishes as set out in their will.  An administrator is a person appointed to
function in place of an executor if the author or artist leaves a will but the
executor is never appointed or declines to serve.  There is no express
definition for the term personal representative but it would seem that it is
intended to cover situations where a person has authority to represent a
deceased author or artist but lacks the formal appointment characteristic of an
executor or administrator.  A trustee is a person who the law recognizes as
having "equitable duties" (as distinct from legal duties) to deal with property
for the benefit of others; a trustee serves a fiduciary for the others, which
means that they must act in the best interest of those whom they serve.  A
trustee may be appointed by a copyright owner to manage their affairs.
</p>
</div>

<div id="grandchildren">
<h3><a name="#grandchildren">Grandchildren</a></h3>
<p>
For the purposes of the termination of transfer provisions, this term refers to
any surviving children of the author or artist's
<a class="glossarylink" href="#children">"Children"</a> if the author or
artist's children died prior to being able to exercise the termination right.
</p>
</div>

<div id="instructional_text">
<h3><a name="#instructional_text">Instructional text (text and/or graphics)</a></h3>
<p>
This term refers to a literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for
publication with the purpose of use in systematic instructional activities. As
a general rule, it is intended to refer to what might loosely be called
"textbook material," whether or not in book form or prepared in the form of a
text. The basic characteristic of an instructional text is the purpose
underlying its preparation is for use in systematic instructional activities;
as opposed to works prepared for use by a general readership.
</p>
</div>

<div id="next_of_kin">
<h3><a name="#next_of_kin">Next of kin</a></h3>
<p>
When used in this tool, this term means an author or artist's "next of kin" as
determined the intestacy laws of the domicile of the author or artist at the
time of his or her death; so, if the author lived in North Carolina at the time
of their death, the laws of North Carolina would determine the identity of
their next of kin, even if they were on holidays in Florida when they died.
</p><p>
This term is relevant to pre-1978 agreements or transfers - if a pre-1978
agreement or transfer was signed by an author or artist's next of kin, it may
be able to be terminated under the termination of transfer provision.  For
post-1978 agreements or transfers, only those signed by the author(s) or
artist(s) may be terminated.
</p>
</div>

<div id="notice_window">
<h3><a name="#notice_window">Notice Window</a></h3>
<p>
This term refers to the period during which a termination notice can be served.
The notice window opens no less than two and not more than 10 years before the
effective termination date selected by the person(s) eligible to terminate the
agreement during the
<a class="glossarylink" href="#termination_window">"Termination Window."</a>
Because the termination window dates for agreements entered into after 1978
vary depending on whether the agreement includes the right of publication, the
notice window estimates that you receive in the information sheet if you have
an open notice window may start 5 years earlier or finish 5 years later that
the actual notice window dates for post-1978 agreements.  The tool adopts the
broadest possible interpretation of when the
<a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.php#termination_window">"Termination Window"</a>
may be open (and consequently, when the notice window may open) to ensure that
you are able to obtain legal advice on whether the publication right is
included in a post-1978 agreement and to avoid you being excluded from the tool
because of a misunderstanding about the nature of the agreement.
</p>
</div>

<div id="publication_date">
<h3><a name="#publication_date">Publication (of the Work)</a></h3>
<p>
This term is defined by copyright law to mean the distribution of copies of a
work to the public in some manner such as by sale or lending.  But the public
performance or public display of a work does not constitute a publication. This
means, for example, that selling copies of a book or video to the public is a
publication; but performing a play in a theatre is not a publication because no
copy is distributed to the public. Offering to distribute copies of a work to a
person for the purpose of them further distributing, performing or displaying
it to the public does, however, constitute a publication.  This covers, for
example, offering a film to a broadcaster or movie theatre for them to then
show it to the public.
</p>
</div>

<div id="supplementary_work">
<h3><a name="#supplementary_work">Supplementary work</a></h3>
<p>
This term means a work that is created and relates to an existing work by
another author or artist. Examples include forewords, afterwards, pictorial
illustrations, maps, charts, tables, editorial notes, musical arrangements,
answer material for tests, bibliographies and appendixes that refer to an
existing work.
</p>
</div>

<div id="termination_window">
<h3><a name="#termination_window">Termination Window</a></h3>
<p>
This is a 5-year period during which the agreement may be terminated.  The
person(s) eligible to terminate the agreement may select a date within this
window as the effective termination date of the agreement or transfer.
</p><p>
For pre-1978 agreements, the termination window starts 56 years after the date
on which copyright was secured or January 1, 1978, whichever is later.
</p><p>
For post-1978 works, the termination window starts at the end of 35 years from
the date of execution of the agreement, or, if the agreement includes the right
of publication, at the end of 35 years from the date of publication or at the
end of 40 years from the date of execution of the agreement, whichever is
later.  Because the termination window dates vary depending on whether a
post-1978 agreement includes the right of publication, the estimated dates for
the termination window in the information sheet that you receive if you have an
open <a class="glossarylink" href="glossary.php#notice_window">notice
window</a> will be 5 years longer than the actual termination window.  The tool
adopts the broadest possible interpretation of when the termination window may
be open to ensure that you are able to obtain legal advice on whether the
publication right is included in the agreement and to avoid you being excluded
from the tool because of a misunderstanding about the nature of the agreement.
</p>
</div>

<div id="widow">
<h3><a name="#widow">Widow(er)</a></h3>
<p>
When used in this tool, this term means the surviving spouse of the author or
artist.  For post-1978 agreements, the term is defined to mean the surviving
spouse according to the law governing in the author or artist's residence, as
at the time of the author or artist's death regardless of whether the spouse
later remarries. For pre-1978 agreements, there is no precise definition of
this term and it is unclear as to whether a spouse who later remarries still
qualifies as a widow(er).  If divorce occurs, then the surviving spouse
probably does not qualify as a widow for the purposes of this tool regardless
of the date of the agreement that you wish to terminate.
</p><p>
If you are unsure about whether a person qualifies as a "widow(er)" or not,
it's probably best to interpret this term broadly as possible so that you can
see if a termination right otherwise exists and then, if it does, this issue
can be raised with the attorney who assists in progressing the termination
claim.
</p>
</div>

<div id="will">
<h3><a name="#will">Will</a></h3>
<p>
This term refers to a person's last will and testament.  Because
copyright is a form of personal property, it can be bequeathed to
people by an author or artist (or one of their successors) in their
will.
</p>
</div>

<div id="work">
<h3><a name="#work">Work (protected by copyright law)</a></h3>
<p>
The technical meaning for this term is an original, creative expression that is
embodied in a tangible form. Under US copyright law, this means that the work
must have a minimum "spark of creativity" and must be recorded somehow, either
written down, saved to disc, filmed, or recorded in such a fashion that it can
be reproduced again.
</p>
</div>

<div id="work_for_hire">
<h3><a name="#work_for_hire">Work for hire</a></h3>
<p>
This terms means either a work created in
<a class="glossarylink" href="#scope_of_employment">circumstances of employment</a>
or a work was specially ordered or commissioned as one of the nine categories
specified by the US Copyright Act for works for hire and the parties agreed and
signed in writing that the work was a "work for hire." The nine categories set
out by statute are: (i) a contribution to a collective work, (ii) as part of a
motion picture or other audiovisual work, (iii) a translation, (iv)
supplementary work, (v) as a compilation, (vi) an instructional text, (vii) a
test, (viii) answer material for a test, (ix) an atlas.  For more information
about "works for hire," please see
<a href="faq.php#What_kinds_of_agreements_cannot_be_terminated.3F">What kinds
of agreements cannot be terminated?</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="written_agreement">
<h3><a name="#written_agreement">Written agreement</a></h3>
<p>
When used in this tool, this term means a document or some other form of
writing that records the parties' agreement. As a general rule, the term means
that the entire or a substantial part of the agreement between the parties is
recorded in the one document. Sometimes there may be more than one document,
if, for example, the parties have later varied their agreement by a new
document that serves as an addendum, appendix or some other variation of the
original document or an exchange of correspondence.
